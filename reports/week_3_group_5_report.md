### 3. Exploratory plots (optional)

Feel free to create some basic plots if they are necessary to understand the dataset.

### 4. Data cleaning procedure

# Suggested notebook structure

## Title of the notebook

### Libraries Loading

The libraries you are using

### Data Loading

How you are loading the data

### Data Initial Inspection

The initial status of the dataset in its raw form.

### Data Cleaning

Very explicit step by step procedure of data cleaning. Imagine that other person from other group or department needs to understand what you did.

### Data Final Inspection

The final status of the dataset after cleaning.

### (Optional) Basic exploration plots

You can start visualizing here some basic distributions and by using histograms, boxplots and start creating some barplots. Nothing fancy.
